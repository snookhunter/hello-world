# hello-world
My first repository as i learn how to use github
My name is Jim and I hope to use github to learn how to code.  
I am not quite sure where this journey will take me, but I am excited to start.  
I've never really known how to learn how to code.  Everyone has always said you just start.  Well, here goes.
